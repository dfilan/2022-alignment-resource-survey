# 2022 alignment resource survey

Results from a survey I ran in 2022 asking people how useful they found various resources in AI alignment, and whether they would recommend those resources. The survey focusses on "secondary resources": that is, not primary resource outputs, but resources that summarize, discuss, analyze, or propose concrete research efforts.

`Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` are there because I kinda like pipenv, but you can just use your favourite virtual environment, the only dependency is numpy.

`ai-alignment-resource-survey.csv` is a CSV of survey results. Note that I have redacted some comments or parts of comments that could reveal the identity of the person taking the survey.

`quick-takeaways.md` is my blog post about the results.

`survey_analysis.py` is a python script to analyze the results. It has a bunch of commented-out sections that print out data, to see the analysis uncomment the sections of interest.

`survey_code.txt` is the GuidedTrack code that specifies the survey.
